This project consists of research code designed to model speech rates as a function of lexical memory retrieval. In particular, the goal
is to continuously model the activation of each target word, and investigate how that influences speech rate at that moment. Computing
the activation for each word continuously relies on the time-annotated version of the Switchboard corpus, ngram counts, and pointwise
mutual information. 

This code is not necessarily designed for public use, but to document the process which produced a paper. The paper can be found below.
